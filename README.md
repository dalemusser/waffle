## 🧇 The WAFFLE Manifesto

Web Application Framework for Flavorful Layered Engineering

### 🍴 Go With WAFFLE

WAFFLE is the framework that helps your ideas go from sketch to scale. [**Go**](https://go.dev/) build something structured. [**Go**](https://go.dev/) layer your logic. [**Go**](https://go.dev/) serve your app hot.

WAFFLE is for developers who go fast, go clean, and go deep — without losing flavor. It’s the kind of framework you go back to, again and again, because it just goes.

### 🧩 What Makes WAFFLE Go

- Go modular: Each layer — routing, logic, persistence — is its own square. Stack what you need, skip what you don’t.
- Go simple: WAFFLE favors clarity over cleverness. You go in, build fast, and go live.
- Go scalable: Whether you’re serving one user or a full brunch crowd, WAFFLE goes the distance.
- Go joyful: Engineering should feel like breakfast with friends — warm, structured, and worth waking up for.
- Go flavorful: No dry boilerplate. WAFFLE is seasoned with delight and built to be savored.

### 🌐 The WAFFLE Way

WAFFLE is the grid beneath your ideas, the stack that makes your projects rise, and the flavor that keeps you going.

We believe in:
- Go clean

- Go again

We *really* believe in [**Go**](https://go.dev/).
