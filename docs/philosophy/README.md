# WAFFLE Philosophy

*Foundational thinking about what WAFFLE is, why it exists, and how to think about building on it.*

---

## What This Section Is

This section contains **perspective-setting documentation** — not instructions on how to do something, but explanations of *why* things are the way they are and *how* to think about the choices you'll make when building on WAFFLE.

These are the lectures, the architectural discussions, the opinionated-but-open-minded takes on web development that inform WAFFLE's design.
